# Week 6 - Class 4  

## Lab Assignment  
* Disable ARC for the `Employee` and `Person` class using the `-fno-objc-arc` compiler flag, and refactor to properly manage memory allocation for these classes.  
* Implement `KVO` to have your `UITableView` automatically `reloadData()` each time a new `Employee`
 is added to our `EmployeeDatabase`.  
* Look up in the documentation, and implement, a swipe to delete on your `UITableView` to support deleting employees from the `EmployeeDatabase`.  

### Stretch Goals  
* Implement the `UITableViewDelegate`, and it's method `didSelectRowAtIndex`, to allow the user to select a specific employee on the `UITableView`. Implement a new `UIViewController` called `EmployeeDetailViewController`, so upon selection of a specific cell, the user is presented with `EmployeeDetailViewController` to display more information about the employee that was selected.
