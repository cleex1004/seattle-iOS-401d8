# Week 6 - Class 28  

## Lab Assignment  
* Embed the `ViewController` into a `NavigationController`.  
* Create a new `UIViewController` called `AddEmployeeViewController`.  
	* Setup `AddViewController` in storyboard with text fields for each model variable(firstName, lastName, email).
	* Add `Save` and `Cancel` buttons.  
* Add UIBarButton to the ViewController's NavigationBar & create a segue to the `AddViewController`.  
	* When pressed, this button should present modally the `AddEmployeeViewController` to properly create a new `Employee`.
