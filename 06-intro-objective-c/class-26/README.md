# Week 6 - Class 1
## Lab Assignment
* Create a new Single View Application, with the language set to Objective-C.   
* Create a category of `NSString`. Extend `NSString`'s functionality to have a instance method that returns an array of the words contained in `self`.
* Create another method in the same category that is a class method that takes in a `NSString` and returns the same `NSString` but reversed.  
* Declare a class called `Person` defined with the following properties:
	* `firstName`  
	* `lastName`  
	* `age`  
* Create a subclass of `Person` called `Employee`, and add the following properties to `Employee`:  
	* `employeeNumber`  
	* `yearsEmployed`  
	* `managerName`  
* Define Setter and Getter methods for the new `Employee` properties.  
* Declare a `protocol` called `PersonQueue` with the following methods:  
	* `enqueue`(required): Takes in a `Person`, returns `Void`  
	* `dequeue`(required): Takes no arguments, returns a `Person`  
	* `count`(optional): Takes no arguments, returns an `int`
