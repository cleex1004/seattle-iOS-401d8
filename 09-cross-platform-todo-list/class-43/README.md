# Cross-platform Todo List - Class 43  

## Lab Assignment  
- When saving new `Todo` objects on Firebase, add the `currentUser`'s email to each `Todo`.  
- Implement fetching `Todo`s from Firebase in your TVOS application.  
- When your `TVOS` application first launches, before loading `Todo`s into the `tableView`, you should prompt the user for their email, and populate the `UITableView` with only their associated `Todo`s.  
  - Be creative with the UX for this.  
- When returning to the main thread, use `GCD` for your operations instead of `NSOperationQueue`.  

## Submitting Your Assignment
