# Core Data Hotel: Class 34  

## User Stories (MVP)  
- As an iOS Developer, I want to implement Core Data into my applications, to allow my Model layer objects to be persisted to the device.  
- As a Developer, I want to implement a layout designed programmatically to better understand how storyboards work and to be able to build an application without the use of storyboards or xibs.  

## Technical Requirements  
* Finish up any functionality from previous labs.  
* If not done as part of yesterday's stretch goal, create a `HotelService` class that should abstract and your application's business logic:  
  * booking reservations  
  * checking availability for `Room`s  
* Write 5 additional unit tests, with a minimum of 10 assertions, for the Model layer of your project.  
  * Remember these best practices with testing in iOS though:  
    * F.I.R.S.T - Fast, Isolated, Repeatable, Self-verifying, Timely  
    * Do not test Apple's methods(alloc, init, addObject, append, viewDidLoad, etc).  
* Migrate your existing model into a new model with at least one new attribute.  
* Implement analytics into your app, using Fabric, or a comparable framework.
